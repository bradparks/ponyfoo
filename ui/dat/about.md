I am Nicolás Bevacqua and I ❤ the web. I founded Pony Foo as a blog [in late 2012][pfb]. Early in 2016 I launched [Pony Foo Weekly][pfw] _-- a newsletter about the open web, highlighting the most important news every thursday._ Now the platform is open to guest posts from [contributing writers][contrib].

You can [join us][ju] if you'd like!

I am a [consultant][consult], a conference [speaker][speaking], the author of [JavaScript Application Design][jsad], an [opinionated blogger][profile], and an [open-source][oss] evangelist. I participate actively in the online JavaScript community as [@nzgb][twitter] on Twitter -- as well as *offline*, in beautiful Buenos Aires.

I like writing about the current [state of the web][stop], new features coming our way in [ES6][es6], leveraging [web performance][perf] optimization to make our sites much faster, the importance of [progressive enhancement][pe], sane [build processes][ggw], and improving quality in your applications with [modular design][plainjs]. I used to spend a lot of my time answering questions on [Stack Overflow][so], but now I spend most of that time doing open-source work instead.

I really enjoy developing small open-source modules that I publish to `npm` and [GitHub][gh]. Some of these are small utilities that work well in both Node.js and the browser, and some others are front-end components that make it easier to use certain parts of the web. My favorite approach to open-source is developing small modules, because that way you can *compose* your code in interesting ways while also fostering *reusability*. Learning how to write modular code is one of the most valuable things you can do to improve your skills as a JavaScript developer.

I have used a variety of tools when it comes to development. Trying out many different tools, *creating some of your own*, and experimenting are the best ways to really understand how they work and the tradeoffs between all the different tools and frameworks out there. I favor simple solutions. That's why I prefer to use `npm run` and Bash in my builds. I also like [React][react] and [Taunus][taunus] when it comes to view rendering, because they're simple and well-performing solutions. I use AWS for deployments because I like having fine-grained control, but I’ve also experimented with other providers like Heroku and Digital Ocean.

Re-inventing the wheel is **a necessary evil** if we want to learn from mistakes made in the past *(regardless of who made them)*.
