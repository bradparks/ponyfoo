          span I first started developing the blogging engine for Pony Foo around mid-2012. I had just read
          span=' '
          a(href='https://amzn.to/1Fwinou', target='_blank') The Pragmatic Programmer
          span=' '
          span and I was looking for a challenge. I built the engine using Node.js and that’s how I got into server-side JavaScript. I really enjoyed publishing articles on a blog, even though &mdash; for a long time &mdash; nobody read what I published. Eventually people started reading the blog, and nowadays some people even go as far as to read minutiae about how the blog came to be. I find that immensely rewarding. Not long after I started blogging I decided to write a book about
          span=' '
          a(href='/books/javascript-application-design') JavaScript Application Design
          span , which was published in February, 2015.

          span Reading every article ever published on Pony Foo &mdash; there’s
          span=' ' + articles.length + ' '
          span of them &mdash; would take you approximately
          span=' '
          span.hy-total-duration=moment.duration(total, 'seconds').humanize()
          span . You better get to it!
