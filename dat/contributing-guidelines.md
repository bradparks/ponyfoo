## Topic Ideas

Writing articles for Pony Foo is a craft of love. The single most important aspect of writing an article for Pony Foo is that you choose *a topic you feel passionate about*. Suppose you have studied a topic in depth, you'd like to share what you know, and you're excited about it. There's nothing stopping you from sharing that accumulated knowledge, then!

When it comes to topics we _-- at Pony Foo --_ are interested in, that's all things web development. Just to give you an extremely incomplete list of examples, you could write about: JavaScript, performance, testing, Progressive Web Apps, frameworks, tooling _--- or anything else you find irresistible._

## Voice and Formatting

As you've probably already noticed from looking at Pony Foo for any amount of time, this is a cheerful place on the web. We're looking for articles that are written in a friendly voice, yet authoritative, yet flexible.

When it comes to written materials, we're looking for articles that contain a healthy number of headers, images, quotes, code blocks, or emoji ðŸŽ‰, so that the article doesn't become an insurmountable pile of words that's too boring for our readers to consume. As usual, use your best judgement, there are no hard rules here.

To give you an idea of what we're looking for, we suggest checking out these inspiring writers: [Sara Soueidan][sara], [Zach Holman][holman], [Zach Leatherman][zach], and [Jeff Atwood][jeff]'s older articles. The best way to learn how to write immersing prose is, unsurprisingly, to read a lot. Maybe check out [The Sense of Style][sense], while you're at it.

There isn't a required word count or minimum amount of images you need to meet. We're looking for well-rounded articles, but a specific word count isn't imposed.

## Authorship Process

We have a friendly and easy-going process. It generally plays out like this:

- You come to us, or we approach you
- You pitch the concept for an article and lay out an outline
- We approve that
- You draft the article
- We edit it
- It is published

That being said, none of that is written in stone.
