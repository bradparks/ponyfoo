### Why Open-Source?

I want this book series to be as widely available as possible, and the best course of action for that purpose was to release the vast majority of the contents as open-source.

The book chapters, code samples, and related graphics are all open-source and free to read online. This is the same repository I work on while writing the book, so you could help me or just take a peek at my writing process and progress.

### Why Crowdfunding?

While I certainly like the idea of giving the book away for free, that doesn't pay any bills.

Obviously, I don't plan on getting rich by writing technical books, there are much more profitable ways of doing that. The goal of the crowdfunding campaign, instead, is to motivate me to keep going. Writing a book, and a book series in particular, can be a demanding and time-consuming job.

### O'Reilly Media

I've partnered with O'Reilly Media to publish the book. This is a paid offering that include a PDF ebook and eventually a print book. The published book is a great way to show your support of my work, by paying a bit for it and telling your friends how awesome my writing is. ðŸ˜˜

We'll start with an Early Release, where you will get the first few chapters. As new chapters come out and old ones get improvements, you'll receive those updates at no extra cost to you. You'll also get an opportunity to steer the direction of my writing efforts by reporting errors and delivering book reviews.
