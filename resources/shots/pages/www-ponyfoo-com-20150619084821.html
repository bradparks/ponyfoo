Tim rightly asserts that the web is not inherently slow, and that if a site is slow it&apos;s merely due to the fact that performance wasn&apos;t prioritized by the site&apos;s maintainers. Similarly, Jeremy posited that services such as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150619084821/https://www.instapaper.com/" aria-label="Save Anything.

Besides being well-designed products that many of us use and love, <em>that shouldn&apos;t be the case</em>, websites should offer that degree of usability, and accessibility on their own, Jeremy argues.</p><p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150619084821/https://www.flickr.com/photos/merlin/sets/72157622077100537/" aria-label="Noise-to-Noise Ratio - flickr.com"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150619084821im_/http://i.imgur.com/1m1L4B5.jpg" alt="content.png"></a></p><p><sub>What if we were to <strong>focus just on the content</strong>? Are any prominent &quot;apps&quot; as ad-dollar hungry as the screenshot above?</sub></p><p>Everyone seems to agree that <strong>the crux of the issue stems from media deals and dollar-hungry marketers who have little interest in much else than profits</strong>. I tend to agree with that view. Most consumer-facing media rely directly on ad revenue, have little to no regard for their typical user when it comes to the effects these ads have on their experience <em>(hey, we call them &quot;users&quot; for a reason, right?)</em>, and simply keep on piling on advertisement.</p><blockquote><p><em>Sure. There&apos;s definitely <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150619084821/https://www.flickr.com/photos/merlin/sets/72157622077100537/" aria-label="Noise-to-Noise Ratio - flickr.com">some excellent original work</a> in there &#x2014; in the middle of all those ads and self-links and chrome and value-added &quot;journalism.&quot;</em></p></blockquote><p>I don&apos;t see this trend being anywhere close to slowing down, <strong>quite the contrary</strong>. Video advertising is becoming more and more prominent, huge unoptimized hero images and annoying interstitial dialogs that want you to download a mobile app that&apos;s supposed to do what the site you&apos;re already on should be doing, along with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150619084821/http://www.cookielaw.org/the-cookie-law/" aria-label="The Cookie Law Explained">ridiculous laws</a>, are all becoming lingua franca in web publishing.</p><p>All of this wouldn&apos;t affect us as web workers if it weren&apos;t for the fact that <em>all the extra cruft is being blamed on the web platform</em> itself, as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150619084821/https://twitter.com/ppk" aria-label="@ppk on Twitter">@ppk</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150619084821/https://twitter.com/tkadlec" aria-label="@tkadlec on Twitter">@tkadlec</a> point out.

Previously I had published <em>a date picker component</em>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150619084821/https://github.com/bevacqua/rome" aria-label="bevacqua/rome on GitHub">Rome</a>, that&apos;s somewhat popular among the nerds. In this article we&apos;ll discuss how you can build and isolate components that have a simple API.</p><p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150619084821/https://github.com/bevacqua/dragula" aria-label="bevacqua/dragula on GitHub">Dragula</a> had a much faster growth rate than <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150619084821/https://github.com/bevacqua/rome" aria-label="bevacqua/rome on GitHub">rome</a> did, and that&apos;s mostly due to the fact that there were basically <em>zero</em> proven libraries that <strong>solve drag &amp; drop</strong> <em>(and drag &amp; drop alone)</em> while being flexible and simple. I emphasize the fact that it does <em>less</em> as a feature, and not a problem. In my experience, I&apos;ve found that the best pieces of code I&apos;ve ever used tend to follow the UNIX philosophy of <strong>doing one thing very well</strong>. Having that kind of focused approach to front-end modules typically isn&apos;t the case. Instead, we often develop solutions that are only useful in our specific use. For example, we may put together an entrenched AngularJS directive that uses other directives or relies on data-binding provided by Angular.</p><p>What&apos;s worse, most often we don&apos;t <em>just</em> limit ourselves to the scope of the libraries we&apos;re currently using, but to the specific scope of the one project we&apos;re working on. This means that now our library can&apos;t be extricated from that database without considerable work. For instance, consider that one time you developed a UI component where the user would type tags in plain text and after typing a delimiter <em>(a comma or a space)</em>, they would get visual feedback into the tag being accepted. Something like the screenshot below.</p><p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150619084821/http://bevacqua.github.io/insignia/" aria-label="Try a demo of Insignia online!"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150619084821im_/https://camo.githubusercontent.com/2c61248fb1272df8a619c95c7acfdb8a3f7193bd/687474703a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f6d6879334676392e706e67" alt="Screenshot of Insignia in action"></a></p><p>Except for the fact that, unless you found what you needed on the open web in the form of a decoupled module, we sometimes commit the crime of tightly coupling the tagging feature to the framework we&apos;re using.

This time around we&apos;ll learn what it takes to automate autoscaling immutable deployments with zero-downtime, while sitting behind a load balancer and using Route 53 for DNS.</p><p>Given the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150619084821/http://ponyfoo.com/articles/immutable-deployments-packer" aria-label="Immutable Deployments and Packer">immutable images we&apos;re now able to build</a>, thanks to the last article, in this article we&apos;ll lay out an architecture, based on <strong>Amazon Web Services</strong>, that&apos;s able to take advantage of those immutable images.</p><h1>Architecture Overview</h1><p>Our journey starts at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150619084821/http://aws.amazon.com/route53/" aria-label="Amazon Web Services Route 53">Route 53</a>, a DNS provider service from Amazon. You&apos;ll set up the initial DNS configuration by hand. I&apos;ll leave the <code class="hljs">NS</code>, <code class="hljs">SOA</code>, and <code class="hljs">TXT</code> records up to you. The feature that interests me in Route 53 is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150619084821/http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/resource-record-sets-choosing-alias-non-alias.html" aria-label="Choosing Between Alias and Non-Alias Resource Record Sets">creating <code class="hljs">ALIAS</code> record sets</a>. These special record sets allow you to bind a domain name to an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150619084821/http://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/" aria-label="Amazon Elastic Load Balancers">Elastic Load Balancer <em>(ELB)</em></a>, which can then distribute traffic among your <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150619084821/http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/" aria-label="Amazon Elastic Cloud Compute">Elastic Cloud Compute <em>(EC2)</em></a> server instances.</p><p>The eye candy in <code class="hljs">ALIAS</code> record sets is that you&apos;re able to use them at the naked, or apex domain level <em>(e.g <code class="hljs">ponyfoo.com</code>)</em>, and not just sub-domains <em>(e.g <code class="hljs">blog.ponyfoo.com</code>)</em>. Our scripts will set up these <code class="hljs">ALIAS</code> records on our behalf whenever we want to deploy to a new environment, also a very enticing feature.</p><blockquote><p>When you finish reading this article, you&apos;ll be able to run the commands below and have your application listening at <code class="hljs">dev01.example.com</code> when they complete, without the need for any manual actions.</p><pre><code class="hljs bash">NODE_ENV=dev01 npm run setup
NODE_ENV=dev01 npm run deploy
</code></pre></blockquote><p>We don&apos;t merely use <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150619084821/http://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/" aria-label="Amazon Elastic Load Balancers">ELB</a> because of its ability to route traffic from naked domains, but also because it enables us to have many web servers behind a single domain, which makes our application more robust and better able to handle load, becoming <em>highly available</em>.</p><p>In order to better manage the instances behind our <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150619084821/http://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/" aria-label="Amazon Elastic Load Balancers">ELB</a>, we&apos;ll use <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150619084821/http://aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/" aria-label="Amazon Auto Scaling Groups">Auto Scaling Groups <em>(ASG)</em></a>. These come at no extra cost, you just pay for the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150619084821/http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/" aria-label="Amazon Elastic Cloud Compute">EC2</a> instances in them. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150619084821/http://aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/" aria-label="Amazon Auto Scaling Groups">ASG</a> will automatically detect <em>&quot;unhealthy&quot;</em> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150619084821/http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/" aria-label="Amazon Elastic Cloud Compute">EC2</a> instances, or instances that the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150619084821/http://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/" aria-label="Amazon Elastic Load Balancers">ELB</a> has deemed unreachable after pinging them with <code class="hljs">GET</code> requests. Unhealthy instances are automatically disconnected from the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150619084821/http://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/" aria-label="Amazon Elastic Load Balancers">ELB</a>, meaning they&apos;ll no longer receive traffic. However, we&apos;ll enable <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150619084821/https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/elb-connection-draining-remove-instances-from-service-with-care/" aria-label="ELB Connection Draining &#x2013; Remove Instances From Service With Care">connection draining</a> so that they gracefully respond to pending requests before shutting down.</p><p>When a new deployment is requested, we&apos;ll create a new <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150619084821/http://aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/" aria-label="Amazon Auto Scaling Groups">ASG</a>, and provision it with the new <code class="hljs">carnivore</code> AMI, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150619084821/http://ponyfoo.com/articles/immutable-deployments-packer" aria-label="Immutable Deployments and Packer">which you may recall from our last encounter</a>. The new <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150619084821/http://aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/" aria-label="Amazon Auto Scaling Groups">ASG</a> will spin as many <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150619084821/http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/" aria-label="Amazon Elastic Cloud Compute">EC2</a> instances as desired. We&apos;ll wait until <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150619084821/http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/" aria-label="Amazon Elastic Cloud Compute">EC2</a> reports every one of those instances are properly initialized and healthy. We&apos;ll then wait until <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150619084821/http://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/" aria-label="Amazon Elastic Load Balancers">ELB</a> reports every one of those instances is reachable via <code class="hljs">HTTP</code>. This ensures that no downtime occurs during our deployment. When every new instance is reachable on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150619084821/http://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/" aria-label="Amazon Elastic Load Balancers">ELB</a>, we&apos;ll remove the outdated <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150619084821/http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/" aria-label="Amazon Elastic Cloud Compute">EC2</a> instances from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150619084821/http://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/" aria-label="Amazon Elastic Load Balancers">ELB</a> first, and <em>downscale the outdated ASG to 0</em>. This will cause the ASG to allow connection draining to kick in on the outdated instances, and terminate them afterwards. Once all of that is over, we delete the outdated ASG.</p><blockquote><p>This approach might not be blazing fast, but I&apos;ll take a speed bump over downtime any day.</p></blockquote><p>Of course, none of this would be feasible if spinning a new instance took 15 minutes while installing software that should&apos;ve been baked into an image. This is why creating those images was crucial. In a slow process such as this, baking images saves us much appreciated startup time.</p></section><section class="at-full"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150619084821/http://ponyfoo.com/articles/leveraging-immutable-deployments" aria-label="Quality content awaits!" class="at-full-button">Read the full article</a></section></section><footer><ul class="tg-tags"><li class="tg-tag-item"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150619084821/http://ponyfoo.com/articles/tagged/bash" aria-label="Find articles tagged &quot;bash&quot;" class="tg-tag">bash</a></li><li class="tg-tag-item"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150619084821/http://ponyfoo.com/articles/tagged/aws" aria-label="Find articles tagged &quot;aws&quot;" class="tg-tag">aws</a></li><li class="tg-tag-item"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150619084821/http://ponyfoo.com/articles/tagged/ami" aria-label="Find articles tagged &quot;ami&quot;" class="tg-tag">ami</a></li><li class="tg-tag-item"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150619084821/http://ponyfoo.com/articles/tagged/immutable-deployments" aria-label="Find articles tagged &quot;immutable-deployments&quot;" class="tg-tag">immutable-deployments</a></li></ul></footer></article><article itemscope="itemscope" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting" class="at-article ly-section"><meta itemprop="dateCreated" content="2015-04-07T18:36:15+00:00"/><meta itemprop="datePublished" content="2015-04-08T12:36:47+00:00"/><meta itemprop="dateModified" content="2015-04-14T12:10:44+00:00"/><meta itemprop="keywords" content="packer,aws,ami,immutable-deployments"/><meta itemprop="discussionUrl" content="http://ponyfoo.com/articles/immutable-deployments-packer#comments"/><header class="at-header uv-clearfix"><h1 class="at-title"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150619084821/http://ponyfoo.com/articles/immutable-deployments-packer" aria-label="Tagged: packer, aws, ami, immutable-deployments" itemprop="headline" class="at-title-link">Immutable Deployments and Packer</a></h1><span class="at-meta"><span>reading time: </span><time aria-label="You're probably faster than that!">22 minutes</time><span>, published </span><time aria-label="Published Wednesday 8th, April 2015 at 12:36" datetime="2015-04-08T12:36:47+00:00">2 months ago</time></span></header><section itemprop="articleBody" class="at-corpus"><section itemprop="about" class="md-markdown at-teaser"><p>A correct<em>er</em> title for this series would be something along the lines of <strong>&quot;Automating autoscaled zero-downtime immutable deployments using plain old bash, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150619084821/http://packer.io/" aria-label="Packer by HashiCorp">Packer</a>, nginx, Node.js, and AWS&quot;</strong>, but that would&apos;ve been kind of long <em>(although it does fit on a tweet)</em>.

I was tempted to call this article <strong>No. You&#x2019;re Missing the Point of Server-Side Rendered JavaScript Apps!</strong>, but that would&apos;ve been way too long, <em>and kind of childish</em>. I agree with the first sentence in his article, where he states that there&apos;s a lot of confusion about <em>&quot;the push to rendering JavaScript apps on the server-side&quot;</em>. There were many other parts of the article I agreed with, and a few I didn&apos;t agree so much with. There&apos;s also some points which weren&apos;t discussed but I&apos;d like to raise myself.</p><p>In the article, Tom goes on to explain how applications rendered on the server-side are clumsy when it comes to responsiveness. This is a fair point, server-side rendered applications typically rely on the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150619084821/http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/post-redirect-get" aria-label="Questions tagged POST-Redirect-Get on StackOverflow">PRG <em>(POST-Redirect-GET)</em> pattern</a>. They have HTML <code class="hljs">&lt;form&gt;</code>s, users <code class="hljs">POST</code> some data, the server processes the request, responds with a redirect to another page, and the client <code class="hljs">GET</code>s that other page. These are pretty much the basics of the web. What&apos;s worse, as Tom notes, is that as you start adding AJAX calls to this server-side rendered content, you are now a slave to both state <em>(what you initially pulled from the server)</em> and behavior <em>(users clicking on things)</em> when it comes to updating the UI. <strong>That is the ultimate nightmare of a web developer.</strong></p><p>Client-side rendered apps, in contrast, can be <em>way faster than that</em>. Once the initial payload is downloaded, interpreted, and executed, client-side JavaScript can set up its own <strong>smart caching on the client-side</strong>, avoiding roundtrips to the server for data it already has, and it can also set up routing on the client-side to emulate incredibly-fast roundtrips.
