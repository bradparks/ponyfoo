They may be part of a <em>&#x201C;framework&#x201D;</em>, or a grouping of UI components that <strong>share an appearance, a similar API, or are otherwise cohesive</strong>. Another category is usually the <em>standalone</em> library. Regardless of whether a standalone library depends on jQuery <em>(I&#x2019;m singling out this scenario because of its prevalence)</em>, they aren&#x2019;t directly related to other UI components, which means <strong>they set their own terms</strong> with regard to API, appearance, and other conventions. Components that are part of a framework are <em>usually hard to integrate</em> with anything that&#x2019;s not part of said framework, resulting in vendor lock-in. Components that aren&#x2019;t part of a framework tend to be easier to integrate with other things, but most often they&#x2019;re <em>not designed</em> to that effect. <mark class="md-mark"><strong>Composability</strong> is a much better alternative, and something we&#x2019;ll explore in depth in this article</mark>.</p><blockquote><p>Before I go any further, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150724014458/https://github.com/bevacqua/dragula" aria-label="bevacqua/dragula on GitHub"><code class="md-code md-code-inline">dragula</code></a> now has over 7500 stars on GitHub and was even featured on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150724014458/http://thenextweb.com/dd/2015/07/20/less-of-a-drag-maaaaaaaan/" aria-label="Dragula is a great drag and drop library for Web developers and has a killer name">The Next Web</a>! <em>I&#x2019;ll need a few moments</em> to wrap my head around <strong>that</strong>! Wow.</p><p>If you&#x2019;ve never seen <code class="md-code md-code-inline">dragula</code>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150724014458/http://bevacqua.github.io/dragula/" aria-label="dragula on GitHub Pages">check out the demo</a> to get an idea of what it does.</p></blockquote><p>Instead of having an autocomplete, a drop down list, a combo box, and a select box, it&#x2019;s nice when you can <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150724014458/https://github.com/bevacqua/horsey" aria-label="bevacqua/horsey on GitHub">do all of that with a single component</a>. That&#x2019;s <em>reusability</em>, you get to use the same component for many different use cases. Another form of reusability is <strong>composability</strong>, <em>the ability to integrate a few different components into a cohesive user experience</em>. It&#x2019;s an often overlooked factor when developing UI components, but I think <strong>good UI components must be highly composable</strong>.</p><p>Composability can also go the opposite direction. Some programs are notoriously modular, and it gets quite a few bits and pieces <em>(otherwise called &#x201C;modules&#x201D;)</em> to get to something that &#x201C;works&#x201D;. One such example is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150724014458/https://github.com/bevacqua/woofmark" aria-label="bevacqua/woofmark on GitHub"><code class="md-code md-code-inline">woofmark</code></a>. This library provides an editor on top of browser HTML <code class="md-code md-code-inline">&lt;textarea&gt;</code> elements. I&#x2019;m not using <code class="md-code md-code-inline">woofmark</code> on ponyfoo quite yet, because I haven&#x2019;t had the time to integrate it here, but I did implement some of the underlying modules. For instance, <code class="md-code md-code-inline">woofmark</code> uses <code class="md-code md-code-inline">megamark</code> under the hood to parse Markdown strings into HTML strings. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150724014458/https://github.com/bevacqua/megamark" aria-label="bevacqua/megamark on GitHub">Megamark</a> is really an abstraction layer on top of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150724014458/https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it" aria-label="markdown-it/markdown-it on GitHub"><code class="md-code md-code-inline">markdown-it</code></a>, which <strong>adds a couple of minor niceties</strong> such as <em>syntax highlighting</em> in code blocks, and the ability to use <kbd>&lt;mark&gt;</kbd> DOM elements to <mark class="md-mark">highlight a <em>&#x201C;fancy&#x201D;</em> piece of text</mark>. Woofmark also uses <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150724014458/https://github.com/bevacqua/domador" aria-label="bevacqua/domador on GitHub"><code class="md-code md-code-inline">domador</code></a> to convert DOM trees or HTML strings back to Markdown, and that has a extensibility structure in place allowing one to extend their understanding of how HTML should be converted into Markdown. If you had custom <em>Markdown -&gt; HTML</em> directives, it&#x2019;s only logical that you implement the reverse for a <em>HTML -&gt; Markdown</em> conversion. With all this converting going on, it&#x2019;s probably <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150724014458/https://github.com/bevacqua/insane" aria-label="bevacqua/insane on GitHub"><code class="md-code md-code-inline">insane</code></a> to try and sanitize the inputs and outputs on your own, so a specialized library takes care of sanitization at the HTML level.</p><p>I&#x2019;ve already mentioned a few modules, each in charge of a different portion of the rich-editing experience in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150724014458/https://github.com/bevacqua/woofmark" aria-label="bevacqua/woofmark on GitHub"><code class="md-code md-code-inline">woofmark</code></a>.

Using <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150724014458/https://github.com/substack/tape" aria-label="substack/tape on GitHub">tape</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150724014458/https://github.com/thlorenz/proxyquire" aria-label="thlorenz/proxyquire on GitHub">proxyquire</a>, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150724014458/https://github.com/cjohansen/Sinon.JS" aria-label="cjohansen/sinon.js on GitHub">sinon</a> is the best possible combination of modules when it comes to testing JavaScript applications, regardless of them being server-side or front-end code.</p><p>In this article well get an in-depth look at these three modules <em>(<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150724014458/https://github.com/substack/tape" aria-label="substack/tape on GitHub">tape</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150724014458/https://github.com/thlorenz/proxyquire" aria-label="thlorenz/proxyquire on GitHub">proxyquire</a>, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150724014458/https://github.com/cjohansen/Sinon.JS" aria-label="cjohansen/sinon.js on GitHub">sinon</a>)</em>, learn why they are better than the competition, how to use them, what each of them is good for, and how they complement each other to provide the ultimate <em>&#x201C;testing harness&#x201D;</em>, figuratively speaking, <strong>no test harness is actually needed!</strong></p><p>While everything else in the JavaScript universe seems to be moving at blisteringly fast speeds, <em>and accelerating</em>, testing is in this weird place where globals are mystically okay.

I&#x2019;ve always found it <del>kind of</del> <em>really</em> weird that test frameworks, which are supposed to be used to <em>improve the code quality</em> around a codebase, may end up doing the exact same opposite by encouraging the usage of globals and awkward monkey patching.</p><p>Nevertheless, let&#x2019;s jump into the awesome world of testing with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150724014458/https://github.com/substack/tape" aria-label="substack/tape on GitHub">tape</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150724014458/https://github.com/thlorenz/proxyquire" aria-label="thlorenz/proxyquire on GitHub">proxyquire</a>, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150724014458/https://github.com/cjohansen/Sinon.JS" aria-label="cjohansen/sinon.js on GitHub">sinon</a>, right after a brief note about the survey I ran last monday.</p><blockquote><h2>A Quick Note About the Survey</h2><p><strong>Many <em>thanks</em></strong> to everyone who took the time to answer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150724014458/https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1pccaq_Tq0QSGKbP9czdEq0uPbFzthKmBY1Kvkjl2Slc/viewform" aria-label="Pony Foo Survey">the survey</a>.

This baseline isn&apos;t just there for SEO purposes or to be more amicable to people turning off JavaScript.</p><p>Think of the ways in which your app is shared on the web. What other places is it rendered to? Services that crawl around it. With client-side rendering, Twitter and Facebook display a pile of garbage instead of <em>descriptive metadata and a thumbnail</em> whenever someone links to your site. Humans might think your site is bogus and not even click on links leading to it, because the description on their Facebook feed just shows a bunch of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150724014458/https://mustache.github.io/" aria-label="Mustache template engine">Mustache templates</a> and gibberish.</p><p>Search engines other than Google are <strong>completely oblivious to your content</strong>. Even Google is not as good at crawling client-side rendered apps as you think they are. Often times, <em>you also get penalized</em> for not being fast enough.</p><p><strong>Mobile performance degrades substantially</strong> in client-side rendered applications as opposed to those server-side rendered. Both because the connection is slower, and because the scripts you depend on to actually render your site take a long time to download. When they do, mobile devices take longer to parse them and execute them, because they&apos;re not as powerful as the Mac Book Pro you use during development.</p><p><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150724014458im_/http://i.imgur.com/EfS2ijh.png" alt="Demand Progress!"></p><p>Not doing server-side rendering might be <strong>just as bad</strong> as not designing a website to be responsive.</p><blockquote><p>It&apos;s <em>about time</em> we <code class="hljs">.shift()</code> <em>&quot;SEO purposes and <code class="hljs">&lt;noscript&gt;</code>&quot;</em> from our list of <strong>excuses</strong> for not doing server-side rendering anymore.</p></blockquote></section><section class="at-full"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150724014458/http://ponyfoo.com/articles/progressive-web" aria-label="Quality content awaits!" class="at-full-button">Read the full article</a></section></section><footer><ul class="tg-tags"><li class="tg-tag-item"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150724014458/http://ponyfoo.com/articles/tagged/progressive-enhancement" aria-label="Find articles tagged &quot;progressive-enhancement&quot;" class="tg-tag">progressive-enhancement</a></li><li class="tg-tag-item"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150724014458/http://ponyfoo.com/articles/tagged/taunus" aria-label="Find articles tagged &quot;taunus&quot;" class="tg-tag">taunus</a></li><li class="tg-tag-item"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150724014458/http://ponyfoo.com/articles/tagged/server-first" aria-label="Find articles tagged &quot;server-first&quot;" class="tg-tag">server-first</a></li><li class="tg-tag-item"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150724014458/http://ponyfoo.com/articles/tagged/browserify" aria-label="Find articles tagged &quot;browserify&quot;" class="tg-tag">browserify</a></li></ul></footer></article><article itemscope="itemscope" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting" class="at-article ly-section"><meta itemprop="dateCreated" content="2015-05-26T12:54:43+00:00"/><meta itemprop="datePublished" content="2015-05-26T12:54:43+00:00"/><meta itemprop="dateModified" content="2015-07-06T12:55:16+00:00"/><meta itemprop="keywords" content="performance,rant,perfschool"/><meta itemprop="discussionUrl" content="http://ponyfoo.com/articles/priorities#comments"/><header class="at-header uv-clearfix"><h1 class="at-title"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150724014458/http://ponyfoo.com/articles/priorities" aria-label="Tagged: performance, rant, perfschool" itemprop="headline" class="at-title-link">Priorities</a></h1><span class="at-meta"><span>reading time: </span><time aria-label="You're probably faster than that!">6 minutes</time><span>, published </span><time aria-label="Published Tuesday 26th, May 2015 at 12:54" datetime="2015-05-26T12:54:43+00:00">2 months ago</time></span></header><section itemprop="articleBody" class="at-corpus"><section itemprop="about" class="md-markdown at-teaser"><p>Peter-Paul Koch <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150724014458/https://twitter.com/ppk" aria-label="@ppk on Twitter">(@ppk)</a> recently wrote <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150724014458/http://www.quirksmode.org/blog/archives/2015/05/tools_dont_solv.html" aria-label="Tools don&#x2019;t solve the web&#x2019;s problems, they ARE the problem - quirksmode.org">an article</a> that generated noticeable turmoil.

Are any prominent &quot;apps&quot; as ad-dollar hungry as the screenshot above?</sub></p><p>Everyone seems to agree that <strong>the crux of the issue stems from media deals and dollar-hungry marketers who have little interest in much else than profits</strong>. I tend to agree with that view. Most consumer-facing media rely directly on ad revenue, have little to no regard for their typical user when it comes to the effects these ads have on their experience <em>(hey, we call them &quot;users&quot; for a reason, right?)</em>, and simply keep on piling on advertisement.</p><blockquote><p><em>Sure.

Video advertising is becoming more and more prominent, huge unoptimized hero images and annoying interstitial dialogs that want you to download a mobile app that&apos;s supposed to do what the site you&apos;re already on should be doing, along with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150724014458/http://www.cookielaw.org/the-cookie-law/" aria-label="The Cookie Law Explained">ridiculous laws</a>, are all becoming lingua franca in web publishing.</p><p>All of this wouldn&apos;t affect us as web workers if it weren&apos;t for the fact that <em>all the extra cruft is being blamed on the web platform</em> itself, as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150724014458/https://twitter.com/ppk" aria-label="@ppk on Twitter">@ppk</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150724014458/https://twitter.com/tkadlec" aria-label="@tkadlec on Twitter">@tkadlec</a> point out.

Previously I had published <em>a date picker component</em>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150724014458/https://github.com/bevacqua/rome" aria-label="bevacqua/rome on GitHub">Rome</a>, that&apos;s somewhat popular among the nerds. In this article we&apos;ll discuss how you can build and isolate components that have a simple API.</p><p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150724014458/https://github.com/bevacqua/dragula" aria-label="bevacqua/dragula on GitHub">Dragula</a> had a much faster growth rate than <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150724014458/https://github.com/bevacqua/rome" aria-label="bevacqua/rome on GitHub">rome</a> did, and that&apos;s mostly due to the fact that there were basically <em>zero</em> proven libraries that <strong>solve drag &amp; drop</strong> <em>(and drag &amp; drop alone)</em> while being flexible and simple. I emphasize the fact that it does <em>less</em> as a feature, and not a problem. In my experience, I&apos;ve found that the best pieces of code I&apos;ve ever used tend to follow the UNIX philosophy of <strong>doing one thing very well</strong>. Having that kind of focused approach to front-end modules typically isn&apos;t the case. Instead, we often develop solutions that are only useful in our specific use. For example, we may put together an entrenched AngularJS directive that uses other directives or relies on data-binding provided by Angular.</p><p>What&apos;s worse, most often we don&apos;t <em>just</em> limit ourselves to the scope of the libraries we&apos;re currently using, but to the specific scope of the one project we&apos;re working on. This means that now our library can&apos;t be extricated from that database without considerable work. For instance, consider that one time you developed a UI component where the user would type tags in plain text and after typing a delimiter <em>(a comma or a space)</em>, they would get visual feedback into the tag being accepted. Something like the screenshot below.</p><p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150724014458/http://bevacqua.github.io/insignia/" aria-label="Try a demo of Insignia online!"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150724014458im_/https://camo.githubusercontent.com/2c61248fb1272df8a619c95c7acfdb8a3f7193bd/687474703a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f6d6879334676392e706e67" alt="Screenshot of Insignia in action"></a></p><p>Except for the fact that, unless you found what you needed on the open web in the form of a decoupled module, we sometimes commit the crime of tightly coupling the tagging feature to the framework we&apos;re using. Or to a library. Or to our application. Or to a specific part of our application.</p><p>It would be best if were able to identify what it is that we&apos;re trying to accomplish <em>(in this case, improve the UX on an input field for tags)</em>, isolate that into its own module, and come up with the simplest possible API. Coming up with a simple API is often a dreadful task, and in this article I&apos;ll try to put together advice and explain my thought process while designing them.</p></section><section class="at-full"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150724014458/http://ponyfoo.com/articles/designing-front-end-components" aria-label="Quality content awaits!" class="at-full-button">Read the full article</a></section></section><footer><ul class="tg-tags"><li class="tg-tag-item"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150724014458/http://ponyfoo.com/articles/tagged/front-end" aria-label="Find articles tagged &quot;front-end&quot;" class="tg-tag">front-end</a></li><li class="tg-tag-item"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150724014458/http://ponyfoo.com/articles/tagged/modularity" aria-label="Find articles tagged &quot;modularity&quot;" class="tg-tag">modularity</a></li><li class="tg-tag-item"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150724014458/http://ponyfoo.com/articles/tagged/rome" aria-label="Find articles tagged &quot;rome&quot;" class="tg-tag">rome</a></li><li class="tg-tag-item"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150724014458/http://ponyfoo.com/articles/tagged/insignia" aria-label="Find articles tagged &quot;insignia&quot;" class="tg-tag">insignia</a></li><li class="tg-tag-item"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150724014458/http://ponyfoo.com/articles/tagged/dragula" aria-label="Find articles tagged &quot;dragula&quot;" class="tg-tag">dragula</a></li><li class="tg-tag-item"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150724014458/http://ponyfoo.com/articles/tagged/horsey" aria-label="Find articles tagged &quot;horsey&quot;" class="tg-tag">horsey</a></li></ul></footer></article><article itemscope="itemscope" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting" class="at-article ly-section"><meta itemprop="dateCreated" content="2015-04-20T04:21:59+00:00"/><meta itemprop="datePublished" content="2015-04-20T14:00:20+00:00"/><meta itemprop="dateModified" content="2015-04-28T12:07:40+00:00"/><meta itemprop="keywords" content="front-end,modularity,javascript,components"/><meta itemprop="discussionUrl" content="http://ponyfoo.com/articles/great-web-module-compendium#comments"/><header class="at-header uv-clearfix"><h1 class="at-title"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150724014458/http://ponyfoo.com/articles/great-web-module-compendium" aria-label="Tagged: front-end, modularity, javascript, components" itemprop="headline" class="at-title-link">The Great Web Module Compendium</a></h1><span class="at-meta"><span>reading time: </span><time aria-label="You're probably faster than that!">7 minutes</time><span>, published </span><time aria-label="Published Monday 20th, April 2015 at 14:00" datetime="2015-04-20T14:00:20+00:00">3 months ago</time></span></header><section itemprop="articleBody" class="at-corpus"><section itemprop="about" class="md-markdown at-teaser"><p>For the past few months I&#x2019;ve developed quite the number of front-end modules.
